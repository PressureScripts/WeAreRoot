# Advanced Malware Scanner and Firewall

Welcome to the **Advanced Malware Scanner and Firewall** repository! This project is a comprehensive solution designed to enhance cybersecurity by detecting and removing malware, as well as implementing a basic firewall to monitor and block unauthorized network access.

## Features

### Malware Scanner
- **Extended Virus Signature Database**: Detects a wide range of malware using a comprehensive list of known virus signatures.
- **Efficient Scanning**: Scans directories for malicious files and computes file hashes to identify potential threats.
- **Automatic Removal**: Provides the option to automatically remove detected malware, ensuring your system remains clean and secure.
- **Detailed Logging**: Logs all scanning activities and errors, offering transparency and ease of debugging.

### Firewall
- **Network Monitoring**: Monitors incoming and outgoing network connections in real-time.
- **Unauthorized Access Blocking**: Detects and logs unauthorized access attempts from unrecognized IP addresses.
- **Configurable Access**: Allows specification of allowed IP addresses, providing flexible control over network access.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.6+**
- **Virtual Environment**: Recommended for dependency management.
- **Required Libraries**: Listed in `requirements.txt`.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/advanced-malware-scanner-firewall.git
   cd advanced-malware-scanner-firewall
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

### Usage

1. **Run the Malware Scanner**:
   ```bash
   python malware_scanner.py
   ```

2. **Run the Firewall**:
   ```bash
   python firewall.py
   ```

### Configuration

- **Malware Signatures**: Update `MALWARE_SIGNATURES` in `malware_scanner.py` to include new virus signatures.
- **Allowed IPs**: Configure `allowed_ips` in `firewall.py` to specify which IP addresses are permitted to access the network.
